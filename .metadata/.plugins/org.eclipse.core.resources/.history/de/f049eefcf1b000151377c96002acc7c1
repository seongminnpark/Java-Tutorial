		/* Passing(we call it *passing* a variable) our number to the string format function using a variable yielded these advantages:
		 * 
		   1. Imagine typing 989288478 directly into the string, 4 times. There is much room for mistake if we retype every single time.
		      Values will get much, much more complicated as we progress.
		      
		   2. Since our special number is declared only once in the code, we only have to change that single line to effect every line in which the variable is mentioned.
		   
		   -> The two advantages above can be overlooked if you are an obsessively meticulous person. But the third one can't:
		   
		   3. We may not know the value we need to print as we are writing the program.
		      For example, we might want to ask the user to input a number. Or we might want to perform specific operations to the value before 
              printing it out, like in the 4th print in the example code. 
              Using variables ensure the data we need to place at certain places in code are indeed there.
